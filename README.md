# To-DoList
I plan to develop a to-do list application. My application will have different types of list actionable items, such as; things to be bought (groceries and etc), things to do for school, things to do for work, and things to do for your family, and will also handle the date and time each item needs to be taken care of. Ideally I would like to assign importance levels to each actionable item.
